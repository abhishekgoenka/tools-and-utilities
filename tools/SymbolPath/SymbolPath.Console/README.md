# SymbolPath
The debugger uses either the symbol search path that is specified by the user—which is found in Options\Debugging\Symbols in Visual Studio—or the _NT_SYMBOL_PATH environment variable. 

SymbolPath utility sets symbol search path in _NT_SYMBOL_PATH environment variable. [Download](https://github.com/abhishekgoenka/tools-and-utilities/blob/master/tools/binaries/SymbolPath.exe)
